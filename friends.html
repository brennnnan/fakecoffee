						Cold teas have revolutionized the world of high quality teas to provide an entirely new and exciting product: cold teas. Yes, iced teas have been around for a while. Yes, most of the time I drink cold tea it is because I forgot about my cup of warm tea and went to go do something else before I remembered it. But this Montreal company is trying to share their human experience with the world, through tea: the experience of being cold all the time for 6 months straight
